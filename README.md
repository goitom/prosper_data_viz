#Summary
========
This visualization summarizes and explains state level loan data from the Prosper Loan Dataset. It compares total loan amounts across years and states to show
geographic and temporal trends. 

#Design
=======
I decided to use a bubble chart to help people visualize the relative size of the loan amounts across space and time.

#Feedback
=========
I was asked by my reviewer to add an additional button to breakout the loan amounts by state as well as by year.

#Resources
==========
I am heavily indebted to the following post/tutorial on creating an animated bubble chart in d3: http://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_in_js.html. This visualization is an adaptation of the tutorial, with comments from the original included where appropriate.
In addition, I used the following color generating tool to create the categorical colors that I assigned to the different states: https://jnnnnn.github.io/category-colors-constrained.html
